## Hyperledger Fabric IOTData project ( HL v1.1)
Hyperledger Fabric is a platform for distributed ledger solutions, underpinned by a modular architecture delivering high degrees of confidentiality, resiliency, flexibility and scalability. It is designed to support pluggable implementations of different components, and accommodate the complexity and intricacies that exist across the economic ecosystem.
Hyperledger Fabric delivers a uniquely elastic and extensible architecture, distinguishing it from alternative blockchain solutions. Planning for the future of enterprise blockchain requires building on top of a fully-vetted, open source architecture; Hyperledger Fabric is your starting point.
Itâ€™s recommended for first-time users to begin by going through the Getting Started section in order to gain familiarity with the Hyperledger Fabric components and the basic transaction flow. Once comfortable, continue exploring the library for demos, technical specifications, APIs, etc.
